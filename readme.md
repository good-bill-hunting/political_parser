Basic Steps of the legislative process:
1. First, a Representative sponsors a bill. 
2. The bill is then assigned to a committee for study. 
3. If released by the committee, the bill is put on a calendar to be voted on, debated or amended. 
4. If the bill passes by simple majority (218 of 435), the bill moves to the Senate. 
5. In the Senate, the bill is assigned to another committee and, if released, debated and voted on. 
6. If the Senate makes changes, the bill must return to the House for concurrence.  
7. The resulting bill returns to the House and Senate for final approval. 
8. The President then has 10 days to veto the final bill or sign it into law.
