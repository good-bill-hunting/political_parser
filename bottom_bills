Whereas the Alliance to Save Energy was founded by Senators Charles H. Percy and 
        Hubert H. Humphrey;
Whereas the Alliance to Save Energy is a unique national, nonprofit, bipartisan 
        public-policy organization that works with prominent leaders in the 
        fields of business, government, education, the environment, and consumer

        the world and has worked to launch affiliate organizations such as the 
        European Alliance to Save Energy and the Australian Alliance to Save 
        Energy;
Whereas the Alliance to Save Energy has shown that energy efficiency and 
        conservation measures taken by the United States during the past 35 
        years have caused annual energy consumption in the United States to 
        decrease by more than 52 quads;
Whereas the Alliance to Save Energy is recognized across the United States as an

Whereas the Alliance to Save Energy contributes to a variety of educational and 
        outreach initiatives, including--

    (1) the award-winning Green Schools and Green Campus programs;

        efficiency.

        April 23, 2012.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands contain 
        significant natural resources, including important wildlife 
        habitat, several riparian corridors, extensive wetlands, ponds 
        and other water sources, cypress groves, meadows, and sand 
        dunes that should be preserved for present and future 
        generations.
            (2) The ocean and coastal ecosystems adjacent to the Point 
        Arena-Stornetta Public Lands are internationally recognized as 
        significant centers of coastal upwelling that support the 
        diverse, abundant and productive marine ecosystems and wildlife 
        underlying the local economy and identity of coastal 
        communities.
            (3) The Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands tell an 
        important story about California's coastal prehistory and 
        history in the context of the surrounding region and 
        communities.
            (4) The coastal area surrounding the Point Arena-Stornetta 
        Public Lands was traditionally used by Indian people, including 
        the Pomo Indian tribes.
            (5) The Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands are historically 
        associated with adjacent lands managed for the enjoyment of 
        current and future generations, including the Arena Rock Marine 
        Natural Preserve, and Manchester Beach State Park.
            (6) The Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands represent a 
        model partnership where future management can be successfully 
        accomplished among the Federal Government, State of California, 
        Mendocino County, local communities, and private groups.
            (7) Permanent protection of the Point Arena-Stornetta 
        Public Lands will provide important economic benefits to 
        surrounding communities, and has broad public support.
            (8) The Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands would make a 
        significant addition to the California Coastal National 
        Monument and National Landscape Conservation System 
        administered by the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land 
        Management.
            (9) Statutory protection is needed for Point Arena-
        Stornetta Public Lands to ensure that it remains a part of our 
        historic, cultural, and natural heritage and a source of 
        inspiration for the people of the United States.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect, conserve, and 
enhance for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations 
the unique and nationally important historical, natural, cultural, 
scientific, educational, scenic, and recreational values of the Point 
Arena-Stornetta Public Lands, while allowing certain recreational and 
research activities to continue.

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To establish a national, toll-free telephone parent helpline to provide 
  information and assistance to parents and caregivers of children to 
              prevent child abuse and strengthen families.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Parent Helpline Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) There are approximately 149,000,000 parents and 
        caregivers in the United States.
            (2) Many parents and caregivers do not always have 
        immediate access to a caring and supportive person to help them 
        address various challenges with their children.
            (3) Parents and caregivers could benefit from an effective 
        helpline that fosters the strengths parents have, which would 
        improve family and peer relationships, as well as community 
        life and society overall.
            (4) Congress recognizes that helpline prevention services 
        will empower parents and caregivers to positively address child 
        care issues and help address child maltreatment, drug and 
        alcohol problems, mental health, and personal growth and 
        development.

SEC. 3. GRANT TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL PARENT HELPLINE.

    Title I of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (42 U.S.C. 
5101 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 103 the following:

``SEC. 103A. GRANT TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL PARENT HELPLINE.

    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary may award a grant to one or more 
nonprofit entities to--
            ``(1) provide for the establishment and ongoing operation

        child abuse and strengthen families; and
            ``(2) create and maintain an Internet website with vital 
        information and resources for parents and caregivers to address

        who are facing parenting challenges; and
            ``(2) a link to needed resources, with a focus on weekly 
        shared leadership groups available nationwide.
    ``(e) Reports and Evaluation.--The entity receiving a grant under

                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 17, 2012

Ms. Landrieu (for herself, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and Ms. 
  Murkowski) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and 
  referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To amend title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act to preserve 
    consumer and employer access to licensed independent insurance 
                               producers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Independent Health 
Insurance Advisors Act of 2012''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Licensed independent insurance producers (agents and 
        brokers) provide a wide range of services for both individual 
        consumers and the business community. Producers interface with 
        insurers, acquire quotes, analyze plan options, and consult 
        clients through the purchase of health insurance.
            (2) Licensed independent insurance producers provide 
        guidance regarding benefit and contribution arrangements to 
        ensure compliance with applicable State and Federal laws and 
        regulations; assist with establishing section 125 plan tax 
        savings under the Internal Revenue Code, health reimbursement 
        arrangements, flexible spending arrangements, evaluating and 
        securing small business tax credits as provided in the Patient 
        Protection and Affordable Care Act, and other programs to 
        maximize tax advantages and ensure compliance with applicable 
        Internal Revenue Service guidelines; create educational 
        materials and provide on-site assistance to aid in employee 
        benefit communication; assist in managing eligibility for new 
        hires and terminated employees; provide advocacy for employees 
        through the health insurance claim process; and advocate for 
        employers with insurers in developing proposals, renewals, and 
        for service issues throughout the year.
            (3) In order to meet these responsibilities, licensed 
        independent insurance producers are required to complete 
        continuing education on an ongoing basis in order to maintain 
        appropriate licenses. This requirement to maintain educational 
        standards helps assure the insured public that producers remain 
        current with the ever-evolving insurance market.
            (4) It is essential that licensed independent insurance 
        producers continue to perform these duties, and others, as the 
        Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has made significant 
        changes to the regulatory environment for health plans. To 
        understand these changes, employers and consumers will need 
        professional guidance even more in the future. This service is 
        especially important for small businesses, as such producers 
        often fill the role of a human resources department as well as 
        professional consultant.
            (5) The National Association of Insurance Commissioners 
        (NAIC), whose core mission is to protect consumers in all 
        aspects of the business of insurance, strongly advocates for 
        the continuing role of licensed independent insurance producers 
        in health insurance, and has expressed that the ability of 
        insurance agents and brokers to continue assisting health 
        insurance consumers at a time of rapid insurance market changes 
        is more essential than ever. On November 22, 2011, the NAIC 
        adopted a resolution stating that ``Congress should 
        expeditiously consider legislation amending the MLR provisions 
        of the PPACA in order to preserve consumer access to agents and 
        brokers''.
            (6) It is critical that the indispensable role played by 
        licensed independent insurance producers is recognized and 
        protected.

SEC. 3. PROTECTING THE ABILITY OF LICENSED INDEPENDENT INSURANCE 
              PRODUCERS TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC.

    (a) In General.--Section 2718 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 300gg-18), as inserted by section 1001 and amended by section 
10101(f) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 
110-148), is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)(3), by inserting ``, remuneration 
        paid for licensed independent insurance producers,'' after 
        ``State taxes''; and
            (2) in subsection (b)(1)--
                    (A) in the matter preceding clause (i) of 
                subparagraph (A), by inserting ``, remuneration paid 
                for licensed independent insurance producers in the 
                individual and small group market,'' after ``State 
                taxes''; and
                    (B) in subparagraph (B)(i)(II), by inserting ``, 
                remuneration paid for licensed independent insurance 
                producers in the individual and small group market,'' 
                after ``State taxes''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(f) Independent Insurance Producer Remuneration Definitions.--For 
purposes of this section:
            ``(1) The term `independent insurance producer' means an 
        insurance agent or broker, insurance consultant, benefit 
        specialist, limited insurance representative, and any other 
        person required to be licensed under the laws of the particular 
        State to sell, solicit, negotiate, service, effect, procure, 
        renew or bind policies of insurance coverage or offer advice, 
        counsel, opinions, or services related to insurance.
            ``(2) The term `remuneration' means compensation earned 
        from an insurance issuer for services rendered under 
        contractual agreement which may include commissions or any 
        other thing of value but which shall not include production 
        bonuses.''.
    (b) Regulations.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall 
amend any applicable regulations as necessary to implement the 
amendments made by subsection (a).

 Mrs. Maloney (for herself, Mr. Bilirakis, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Sarbanes,

   resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should work within the framework of the 
   United Nations process with Greece to achieve longstanding United 
States and United Nations policy goals of finding a mutually acceptable 
composite name, with a geographical qualifier and for all uses for the 
                 former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

Whereas, on April 8, 1993, the United Nations General Assembly admitted as a 
        member the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, under the name the 
        ``former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'';
Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 817 (1993) states that the 
        international dispute over the name must be resolved to maintain 
        peaceful relations between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of 
        Macedonia and regional stability;
Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the United States in bringing 
        political stability and economic development to the Balkan region, 
        having invested over $20 billion in the countries of the region, thereby 
        creating over 200,000 new jobs, and having contributed over $750 million 
        in development aid for the region;
Whereas Greece has invested over $1 billion in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
        Macedonia, thereby creating more than 20,000 new jobs and having 
        contributed $110 million in development aid;
Whereas H. Res. 356 of the 110th Congress, urged the former Yugoslav Republic of 
        Macedonia to abstain from hostile activities and stop the utilization of 
        materials that violate provisions of the United Nations-brokered Interim 
        Agreement between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece 
        regarding ``hostile activities or propaganda'';
Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) heads of state and 
        government unanimously agreed in Bucharest (April 3, 2008) that ``. . . 
        within the framework of the UN, many actors have worked hard to resolve 
        the name issue, but the Alliance has noted with regret that these talks 
        have not produced a successful outcome. Therefore we agreed that an 
        invitation to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be extended 
        as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been 
        reached. We encourage the negotiations to be resumed without delay and 
        expect them to be concluded as soon as possible'';
Whereas the heads of state and government participating in the meeting of the 
        North Atlantic Council in Strasbourg/Kehl (April 4, 2009), as well as 
        the heads of state and government participating in the meeting of the 
        North Atlantic Council in Lisbon (November 20, 2010), reiterated their 
        unanimous support for the agreement at the Bucharest Summit ``to extend 
        an invitation to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as soon as a 
        mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached within 
        the framework of the UN, and urge intensified efforts towards that 
        goal.'';
Whereas the government in Skopje in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
        through both its policies, activities, and rhetoric over the last few 
        years, has been violating the spirit and the letter of the Interim 
        Agreement (IA) of 1995 between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic 
        of Macedonia, thus undermining the friendly relations between the two 
        countries; and
Whereas authorities in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia urged their 
        citizens to boycott Greek investments in the country and not to travel 
        to Greece: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) urges the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to work 
        within the framework of the United Nations process with Greece 
        to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy 
        goals by finding a mutually acceptable composite name, with a 
        geographical qualifier and for all uses for the former Yugoslav 
        Republic of Macedonia;
            (2) urges the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to 
        abstain from all hostile activities and stop violating 
        provisions of the United Nations-brokered Interim Agreement 
        between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece 
        regarding ``hostile activities or propaganda''; and
            (3) urges the United States Government to work in 
        partnership with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
        allies to uphold previous NATO Summits decisions, with regard 
        to the enlargement issue and extend an invitation to the former 
        Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as soon as a mutually acceptable 
        solution to the name issue has been reached within the 
        framework of the United Nations.

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To promote transportation-oriented development and encourage dedicated 
   revenue sources for urban and regional rail corridor development.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National High Performance Passenger 
Rail Transportation-Oriented Development Act of 2012''.

SEC. 2. TRANSPORTATION-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE.

    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Transportation (in this Act 
referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish an initiative to 
promote passenger rail operations and transportation-oriented 
development by creating incentives for communities to encourage 
dedicated revenue sources for urban and regional rail corridor 
development.
    (b) Implementation.--The Secretary shall appoint a Planning 
Developer to oversee implementation of this initiative. The Planning 
Developer shall report to the Secretary.
    (c) Coordinating Committee.--The Secretary shall harmonize planning 
requirements and direct coordination and administration of the 
initiative between the Federal Railroad Administration and the Federal 
Transit Administration. The Secretary shall appoint a Transportation-
Oriented Development Coordinating Committee composed of the Planning 
Developer as Chair, the Administrator of the Federal Railroad 
Administration, and the Administrator of the Federal Transit 
Administration.

SEC. 3. FEDERAL INCENTIVES.

    (a) Qualified Projects.--
            (1) Criteria.--The Secretary shall establish criteria for 
        the designation of projects qualified for Federal incentives 
        pursuant to this section and the amendments made by this 
        section.
            (2) Types of projects that may qualify.--Projects that may 
        qualify for Federal incentives pursuant to this section and the 
        amendments made by this section are those that contribute to 
        the generation of revenue by the capture of increasing value 
        from development around station areas, as defined by the 
        Secretary, which are likely to make long-term contributions to 
        rail corridor development funds or similar mechanisms that help 
        finance intercity and urban passenger rail infrastructure or 
        operating expenses. Such commercial development or other 
        projects designated as qualified by the Secretary may generate 
        revenue for transportation-oriented development and rail 
        operations in the region by increasing the tax base, promoting 
        job growth, promoting cost effectiveness, facilitating 
        intermodal connectivity, combining congestion relief with 
        station development, stimulating economic development, or any 
        other appropriate means. The capture of increased value shall 
        be through the establishment of special assessment districts or 
        similar mechanisms, and distribution of revenues shall be 
        through rail corridor development funds or similar mechanisms 
        established within the regions.
            (3) Designated coordinating authority.--The Secretary shall 
        designate a State authority, or regional commission in 
        appropriate regions of the country as defined by the Secretary, 
        that petitions the Secretary to participate in the initiative 
        established under section 2. Such designated entity shall 
        provide for coordination among stakeholders, local governments, 
        and private developers in the defined region, and shall endorse 
        each project of, and be the lead party in, an application for 
        Federal incentives pursuant to this section and the amendments 
        made by this section.
    (b) Railroad Rehabilitation Improvement Financing.--Section 502 of 
the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (45 
U.S.C. 822) is amended--

        section 8 of the National High Performance Passenger Rail 
        Transportation-Oriented Development Act of 2012).''; and
            (2) in subsection (b)(1)--
                    (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph 
                (B);
                    (B) by striking the period at the end of 
                subparagraph (C) and inserting ``; or''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following new 
                subparagraph:
                    ``(D) conduct a qualified project (as defined by 
                the Secretary under section 3 of the National High 
                Performance Passenger Rail Transportation-Oriented 
                Development Act of 2012.''.
    (c) Transportation Infrastructure Finance.--Section 601(a)(8) of

                Performance Passenger Rail Transportation-Oriented 
                Development Act of 2012).''.
    (d) Application Priority.--In general, Federal applications to the 
Federal Railroad Administration and Federal Transit Administration for 
railroad projects that participate in the transportation-oriented 
development program under this Act shall receive a priority for funding 
in the application decision process.

Developer and transportation-oriented development initial 
administrative costs of the Federal Railroad Administration and Federal 
Transit Administration for the first 5 years, the Secretary may use 
such funds as necessary which are appropriated for carrying out chapter 
6 of title 23, United States Code.
    (f) Revenue Neutral Program Cost.--The Secretary may establish a 
mechanism whereby amounts used under subsection (e) will be repaid to 
the Secretary for use in carrying out chapter 6 of title 23, United 
States Code. Repayment shall be derived from a small fee to all 
recipients of funding provided under subsection (e). The repayment

   Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 1962 Seattle World's Fair.


_______________________________________________________________________


                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 19, 2012

Ms. Cantwell submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
                     the Committee on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 1962 Seattle World's Fair.

Whereas, on April 21, 2012, the City of Seattle will celebrate the 50th 
        anniversary of the 1962 Seattle World's Fair (referred to in this 
        preamble as the ``Seattle World's Fair''), which showcased the optimism, 
        energy, and innovative spirit of Seattle;
Whereas more than 9,000,000 people visited the Seattle World's Fair, a number 
        that represents roughly 3 times the total population of the State of 
        Washington at the time;
Whereas the Seattle World's Fair brought together the most talented architects 
        of the Pacific Northwest to create a civic legacy and the treasured 
        Seattle Center public space, which includes the Space Needle, the 
        Seattle Center Armory, the Pacific Science Center, the Coliseum (now 
        known as ``Key Arena''), Memorial Stadium, the International Fountain, 
        and the Opera House;
Whereas the Seattle World's Fair facilitated the construction of key 
        transportation infrastructure, including the SR 520 floating bridge, the 
        portion of Interstate 5 that traverses downtown Seattle, and the 
        Monorail;
Whereas, to officially open the Seattle World's Fair, President John F. Kennedy 
        used the same historic telegraphic key that had been used to open the 
        Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle 53 years earlier;
Whereas the attendance of music icon Elvis Presley in Seattle during the filming 
        of the movie ``It Happened at the World's Fair'' further elevated the 
        City of Seattle as an international city for the arts;
Whereas the theme of the Seattle World's Fair, ``science'', foreshadowed 
        regional innovations in technology and advanced manufacturing that now 
        support world leading companies and tens of thousands of high-paying 
        jobs;
Whereas some of the earliest satellite transmissions of telephone calls and 
        television broadcasts occurred at the Seattle World's Fair, and the 
        Seattle area is now home to global information and communications 
        technology companies; and
Whereas the Seattle World's Fair celebrated aviation and the new Space Age, and 
        the aerospace industry in the Seattle area now employs 82,000 people 
        (including 7,000 engineers), generates a combined annual revenue of 
        $32,000,000,000, and includes a cluster of 650 companies: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) celebrates the 50th anniversary of the 1962 Seattle 
        World's Fair;
            (2) commends the City of Seattle for its innovation, 
        growth, and entrepreneurial spirit during the past 50 years;
            (3) supports the ``Next Fifty'' initiative to develop a 
        blueprint for success in Seattle for the next half-century; and
            (4) requests that the Secretary of the Senate transmit an 
        enrolled copy of this resolution to the City of Seattle for 
        appropriate display.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

                             April 19, 2012

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To suspend subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code, 
 commonly known as the Davis-Bacon Act, through the end of fiscal year 
                     2023, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fiscal Responsibility in Federal 
Contracting Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 
        national unemployment rate was 9 percent or higher for all but 
        3 months from July 2009 through September 2011. The 
        unemployment rate remains unacceptably high, with a national 
        unemployment rate of 8.2 percent (12.7 million unemployed 
        persons) in March 2012.
            (2) The Congressional Budget Office predicts that 
        unemployment rates may continue to exceed 8.5 percent. 
        Investment banking firms estimate future unemployment rates 
        between 9.25 percent and 9.5 percent.
            (3) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an average 
        of 15.9 percent of the civilian labor force plus marginally 
        attached workers (individuals not seeking jobs as a result of 
        being discouraged or for another reason) was either unemployed, 
        marginally attached, or underemployed in 2011.
            (4) The Davis-Bacon Act imposes costs on all Federal 
        projects, increasing the costs of those projects by 22 percent 
        comparted to the private sector, and costing the taxpayers as 
        much as $11 billion per year.
            (5) Leaders of both political parties have suspended the 
        Davis-Bacon Act in times of national distress. Presidents 
        Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard M. Nixon, George H.W. Bush, and 
        George W. Bush all suspended the Davis-Bacon Act.
            (6) State-level suspensions of similar State wage acts 
        resulted in a decline in project costs and a significant rise 
        in the number of jobs resulting from these projects.
            (7) Evidence suggests that in times of economic emergency, 
        suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act results in higher employment 
        rates and more jobs as a result of Federal contracts.

SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF THE DAVIS-BACON ACT.

    Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, subchapter IV of 
chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code, commonly known as the 
Davis-Bacon Act, shall have no force or effect through the end of 
fiscal year 2023.

SEC. 4. REPORT.

    Not later than 60 days after the end of each fiscal year through 
fiscal year 2023, the Comptroller General shall submit a report to 
Congress that shows the savings to the Federal government that resulted 
from the suspension of subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United 
States Code, commonly known as the Davis-Bacon Act, since the beginning 
of such suspension through the end of that fiscal year.

_______________________________________________________________________


                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 19, 2012

   Mr. Wicker (for himself, Mr. Coons, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Cardin, Mr. 
    Durbin, Mr. Boozman, and Mr. Bingaman) submitted the following 
  resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
         Supporting the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day.

Whereas April 25th of each year is recognized internationally as World Malaria 
        Day;
Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in many developing 
        countries, despite being completely preventable and treatable;
Whereas fighting malaria is in the national security interest of the United 
        States Government, as reducing the risk of malaria protects members of 
        the Armed Forces of the United States serving overseas in malaria 
        endemic regions, and reducing malaria deaths helps to promote stability 
        in less developed countries;
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 35 
        countries, the majority of which are in sub-Saharan Africa, account for 
        98 percent of global malaria deaths;
Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to and 
        disproportionately affected by malaria;
Whereas malaria greatly affects child health, as children under the age of 5 
        account for an estimated 85 percent of malaria deaths each year;
Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal health, causing complications 
        during delivery, anemia, and low birth weights, with estimates that 
        malaria infection causes 400,000 cases of severe maternal anemia and 
        between 75,000 and 200,000 infant deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa;
Whereas heightened national, regional, and international efforts to prevent and 
        treat malaria over recent years have made measurable progress and helped 
        save hundreds of thousands of lives;
Whereas the World Malaria Report 2011 by the World Health Organization states 
        that in 2011, approximately 50 percent of households in sub-Saharan 
        Africa owned at least 1 insecticide-treated mosquito net (referred to in 
        this preamble as an ``ITN''), and household surveys indicated that 96 
        percent of people with access to an ITN within a household actually used 
        the ITN;
Whereas, in 2010, a total of 185,000,000 people were protected by indoor 
        residual spraying (referred to in this preamble as ``IRS'');
Whereas the World Malaria Report 2011 further states that malaria mortality 
        rates have fallen by more than 25 percent globally, and 33 percent in 
        Africa alone, since 2000;
Whereas the World Malaria Report 2011 further states that out of 99 countries 
        with ongoing malaria transmissions, 43 countries recorded decreases of 
        more than 50 percent in the number of malaria cases between 2000 and 
        2010, and 8 other countries recorded decreases of more than 25 percent;
Whereas continued national, regional, and international investment in efforts to 
        eliminate malaria, including prevention and treatment efforts and the 
        development of a vaccine to immunize children from the malaria parasite, 
        is critical in order to continue to reduce malaria deaths, prevent 
        backsliding in areas where progress has been made, and equip the United 
        States and the global community with the tools necessary to fight 
        malaria and other global health threats;
Whereas the United States Government has played a leading role in the recent 
        progress made toward reducing the global burden of malaria, particularly 
        through the President's Malaria Initiative (referred to in this preamble 
        as ``PMI'') and the contribution of the United States to the Global Fund 
        to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;
Whereas the United States Government is pursuing a comprehensive approach to 
        ending malaria deaths through PMI, the United States Agency for 
        International Development, the National Institutes of Health, the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense, 
        and the private sector focused on helping partner countries to achieve 
        major improvements in overall health outcomes through advances in access 
        to, and the quality of, healthcare services in resource-poor settings; 
        and
Whereas PMI, recognizing the burden of malaria on many partner countries, has 
        set a target of reducing the burden of malaria by 50 percent for 
        450,000,000 people, representing 70 percent of the at-risk population in 
        Africa, by 2015: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day, 
        including the target of ending malaria deaths by 2015;
            (2) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria 
        prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal 
        health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;
            (3) commends the recent progress made toward reducing 
        global malaria deaths and prevalence, particularly through the 
        efforts of the President's Malaria Initiative and the Global 
        Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;
            (4) strongly supports ongoing public-private partnerships 
        to research and develop more effective and affordable tools for 
        malaria diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination;
            (5) recognizes the goals to combat malaria in the Tom 
        Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership 
        Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act 
        of 2008 (Public Law 110-293; 122 Stat. 2918);
            (6) supports continued leadership by the United States in 
        bilateral, multilateral, and private sector efforts to combat 
        malaria as a critical part of the President's Global Health 
        Initiative; and
            (7) encourages other members of the international community 
        to sustain and scale up their support for and financial 
        contributions to efforts worldwide to combat malaria.

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the Senate that public servants should be 
  commended for their dedication and continued service to the United 
             States during Public Service Recognition Week.

Whereas the week of May 6 through 12, 2012, has been designated as ``Public 
        Service Recognition Week'' to honor the employees of the Federal 
        Government and State and local governments of the United States of 
        America;
Whereas Public Service Recognition Week provides an opportunity to recognize and 
        promote the important contributions of public servants and honor the 
        diverse men and women who meet the needs of the United States through 
        work at all levels of government;
Whereas millions of individuals work in government service in every city, 
        county, and State across the United States and in hundreds of cities 
        abroad;
Whereas public service is a noble calling involving a variety of challenging and 
        rewarding professions;
Whereas the Federal Government and State and local governments are responsive, 
        innovative, and effective because of the outstanding work of public 
        servants;
Whereas the United States is a great and prosperous country, and public service 
        employees contribute significantly to that greatness and prosperity;
Whereas the United States benefits daily from the knowledge and skills of these 
        highly trained individuals;
Whereas public servants--

    (1) defend our freedom and advance the interests of the United States 
around the world;

    (2) provide vital strategic support functions to our military and serve 
in the National Guard and Reserves;

    (3) fight crime and fires;

    (4) ensure equal access to secure, efficient, and affordable mail 
service;

    (5) deliver Social Security and Medicare benefits;

    (6) fight disease and promote better health;

    (7) protect the environment and the parks of the United States;

    (8) enforce laws guaranteeing equal employment opportunity and healthy 
working conditions;

    (9) defend and secure critical infrastructure;

    (10) help the people of the United States recover from natural 
disasters and terrorist attacks;

    (11) teach and work in our schools and libraries;

    (12) develop new technologies and explore the Earth, the Moon, and 
space to help improve our understanding of how our world changes;

    (13) improve and secure our transportation systems;

    (14) promote economic growth; and

    (15) assist the veterans of our country;

Whereas members of the uniformed services and civilian employees at all levels 
        of government make significant contributions to the general welfare of 
        the United States, and are on the front lines in the fight to defeat 
        terrorism and maintain homeland security;
Whereas public servants work in a professional manner to build relationships 
        with other countries and cultures in order to better represent the 
        interests and promote the ideals of the United States;
Whereas public servants alert Congress and the public to government waste, 
        fraud, and abuse, and of dangers to public health;
Whereas the men and women serving in the Armed Forces of the United States, as 
        well as those skilled trade and craft Federal employees who provide 
        support to their efforts, are committed to doing their jobs regardless 
        of the circumstances, and contribute greatly to the security of the 
        country and the world;
Whereas public servants have bravely fought in armed conflict in defense of this 
        country and its ideals, and deserve the care and benefits they have 
        earned through their honorable service;
Whereas government workers have much to offer, as demonstrated by their 
        expertise and innovative ideas, and serve as examples by passing on 
        institutional knowledge to train the next generation of public servants; 
        and
Whereas the week of May 6 through 12, 2012, marks the 28th anniversary of Public 
        Service Recognition Week: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of the week of May 6 through 
        12, 2012, as ``Public Service Recognition Week'';
            (2) commends public servants for their outstanding 
        contributions to this great country during Public Service 
        Recognition Week and throughout the year;
            (3) salutes government employees for their unyielding 
        dedication to and spirit for public service;
            (4) honors those government employees who have given their 
        lives in service to their country;
            (5) calls upon a new generation to consider a career in 
        public service as an honorable profession; and
            (6) encourages efforts to promote public service careers at 
        all levels of government.

                             April 18, 2012

Mr. Moran (for himself and Mr. Roberts) introduced the following bill;

    Congress finds that an approximate 180-day period before which 
States and utilities are required to comply with certain new rules 
regarding maximum permissible emissions of ozone, sulfur dioxide, or 
nitrogen oxides under the Cross State Air Pollution Rule is 
insufficient for those States and utilities to achieve that compliance.

        (70 Fed. Reg. 25162 (May 12, 2005)).
            (3) Cross state air pollution rule.--The term ``Cross State

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Higher Education Opportunity Act to restrict institutions 
     of higher education from using revenues derived from Federal 
educational assistance funds for advertising, marketing, or recruiting 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) From 1998 to 2008, enrollment in for-profit 
        institutions of higher education increased by 225 percent, from 
        553,000 students to 1,800,000 students.
            (2) On average, 86 percent of revenues at 15 large, 
        publicly traded companies that operate for-profit institutions 
        of higher education came from the Federal Government through 
        student aid programs.
            (3) In 2009, students who enrolled at for-profit 
        institutions of higher education received $30,000,000,000 in 
        Federal Pell Grants and student loans.
            (4) Eight out of the 10 top recipients of Post-9/11 
        Educational Assistance funds are for-profit institutions of 
        higher education. For-profit colleges received 37 percent 
        ($4,400,000,000) of all Post-9/11 Educational Assistance funds 
        during the 2-year period of August 1, 2009 through July 30, 
        2011.
            (5) Six of the top 10 military tuition assistance 
        recipients are for-profit institutions of higher education. 
        For-profit colleges received half of all tuition assistance 
        dollars--$280,000,000 out of $563,000,000 spent last year.
            (6) The 15 companies that received 86 percent of their 
        revenues from Federal student aid programs spent $3,700,000,000 
        (23 percent of expenditures) on advertising, marketing, and 
        recruitment in fiscal year 2009.
            (7) According to documents obtained by the Committee on 
        Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of the Senate (referred 
        to in this Act as the ``HELP Committee''), 30 companies 
        operating for-profit institutions of higher education spent 
        $4,100,000,000 on advertising, marketing, and recruitment in 
        fiscal year 2009.
            (8) An analysis of 8 publicly traded companies that operate 
        institutions of higher education shows that, on average, they 
        spend 31 percent of expenditures on advertising, marketing, and 
        recruiting.
            (9) Documents obtained by the HELP Committee reveal that 
        for-profit institutions of higher education have created 
        sophisticated marketing plans and employed many third parties 
        as well as large sales forces specifically tasked with 
        enrolling as many students as possible, including veterans, 
        servicemembers, and their families.
            (10) In 2010, an undercover investigation by the Government 
        Accountability Office documented misleading and deceptive 
        recruitment practices at each of 15 for-profit institutions of 
        higher education campuses visited. Misleading statements 
        included information regarding the cost of attendance, 
        transferability of credits, loan repayment by future employers, 
        job placement, and likelihood of graduation.
            (11) Documents produced to the HELP Committee demonstrate 
        that revenue from Federal funds is used to pay recruiters, who, 
        at some for-profit institutions of higher education, are 
        trained to exploit emotional vulnerabilities of prospective 
        students to meet enrollment thresholds.
            (12) Documents produced to the HELP Committee demonstrate 
        that revenues from Federal funds are used to pay very large 
        sales staff titled ``enrollment advisors'', including 8,137, 
        5,669 and 3,069 of such individuals at 3 large for-profit 
        companies.
            (13) The number of enrollment advisors at several for-
        profit institutions of higher education examined by the HELP 
        Committee are very disproportionate with the number of staff 
        engaged in all student support services, including job 
        placement, which were 3,737, 2,582 and 2,472 at the same 3 for-
        profit companies.

SEC. 2. RESTRICTIONS ON SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR RECRUITING AND MARKETING 
              ACTIVITIES.

    Section 119 of the Higher Education Opportunity Act (20 U.S.C. 
1011m) is amended--

                        email, or by other internet communications 
                        regarding enrollment; and

Olver, Mr. McGovern, Mr. Tierney, Mr. Capuano, Mr. Lynch, Ms. Tsongas, 
 Mr. Keating, and Ms. Pelosi) introduced the following bill; which was

To designate the Salt Pond Visitor Center at Cape Cod National Seashore 
  as the ``Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Salt Pond Visitor Center'', and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Thomas Phillip (Tip) O'Neill, Jr., was born on December 
        9, 1912, in the Irish middle-class area of North Cambridge, 
        Massachusetts, to Thomas Phillip O'Neill, Sr., and Rose Ann 
        (Tolan) O'Neill.
            (2) Nicknamed ``Tip'' during his childhood, O'Neill was 
        educated in Roman Catholic schools, graduating from St. John's 
        High School in 1931, where he was captain of the basketball 
        team.
            (3) Tip O'Neill then attended Boston College, where he ran 
        for a Cambridge City Council seat during his senior year--his 
        first attempt at running for office and only electoral defeat.
            (4) Following his graduation from Boston College in 1936, 
        Tip O'Neill was elected to the Massachusetts House of 
        Representatives that same year as a New Deal Democrat whose 
        political philosophy was shaped by his experience growing up in 
        working-class Boston and his strong Catholic faith, which led 
        him to view government as a means for helping the disadvantaged 
        in society.
            (5) In 1949, Tip O'Neill became the first Democratic 
        Speaker in the history of the Massachusetts State Legislature, 
        serving as Speaker until 1952, when he ran successfully for the 
        United States House of Representatives to fill the seat vacated 
        by Senator-elect John F. Kennedy.
            (6) In 1958, inspired by the establishment of the Cape 
        Hatteras National Seashore, a seashore park in North Carolina, 
        Representative Tip O'Neill, along with his close friend and 
        colleague Representative Edward Boland, introduced legislation 
        to protect lands on Cape Cod as a national seashore.
            (7) In describing this area on Cape Cod, Henry David 
        Thoreau had written that ``A man may stand there and put all 
        America behind him'', as the pristine sandy beach, marshes, 
        ponds, and uplands supporting diverse species represent a 
        unique, cherished jewel of nature.
            (8) The legislation established a 40-mile national park 
        along Cape Cod's outer beach, from Chatham through Orleans, 
        Eastham, Wellfleet, Truro, and Provincetown that includes 
        lighthouses, cultural landscapes, and wild cranberry bogs that 
        offer a glimpse of Cape Cod's past and continuing ways of life.
            (9) After introduction of the legislation during the 85th 
        Congress, Tip O'Neill continued to advocate strongly for 
        establishment of the Cape Cod National Seashore, co-sponsoring 
        bills in the 86th and 87th Congresses, testifying at hearings 
        and working to advance the legislation through Congress.
            (10) The legislation was intended to preserve one of the 
        great natural marvels of the United States, with its unbroken 
        beach and moors, marshes, forests, and freshwater ponds that 
        are home to many species of birds, fish, animals, and plants.
            (11) On August 7, 1961, President Kennedy signed into law 
        the legislation authorizing the Cape Cod National Seashore as 
        Public Law 87-126.
            (12) In 1966, the Cape Cod National Seashore was formally 
        established, and Representative O'Neill attended the May 30, 
        1966, ceremony inaugurating the Salt Pond Visitor Center.
            (13) The Cape Cod National Seashore has become a national 
        treasure, with millions of Americans and visitors from around 
        the world enjoying its beauty and remarkable biodiversity.
            (14) Tip O'Neill and his family maintained a home on Cape 
        Cod in Harwich Port, and he was a frequent visitor to the 
        National Seashore during his service in Congress and in his 
        retirement years.
            (15) While in Congress, Tip O'Neill rose quickly through 
        the leadership ranks due to his extraordinary political skills, 
        mastery of the legislative process and sharp wit, serving first 
        as Majority Whip in the House beginning in 1971 and then in 
        1973 as House Majority Leader.
            (16) One of O'Neill's greatest accomplishments as Speaker 
        was the crafting of a peace accord between warring factions in 
        Northern Ireland, during which he worked with fellow Irish-
        American politicians including Senator Edward M. Kennedy to 
        develop the ``St. Patrick's Day declaration'' denouncing 
        violence in Northern Ireland and culminating with the Irish aid 
        package upon the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985.
            (17) On January 3, 1987, Tip O'Neill retired from Congress, 
        having served in public life for 50 years, including 34 years 
        as a Member of Congress and 10 years as Speaker of the House, 
        the longest continuous term of any Speaker since the first 
        Congress met in 1789.
            (18) Tip O'Neill's extraordinary record of public service 
        and tremendous accomplishments for the nation and unmatched 
        attention to the needs of his constituents led President George 
        H.W. Bush in 1991 to present Tip O'Neill with the Presidential 
        Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United 
        States.
            (19) It is also altogether fitting to recognize Tip 
        O'Neill's support for the protection of the natural, historic, 
        and cultural resources of the national parks of Massachusetts.
    (b) Designation.--The Salt Pond Visitor Center at Cape Cod National 
Seashore in Eastham, Massachusetts, is designated as the ``Thomas P. 
O'Neill, Jr. Salt Pond Visitor Center''.
    (c) References.--Any reference to the Salt Pond Visitor Center at 
Cape Cod National Seashore in any law, regulation, map, document, 
record, or other paper of the United States shall be considered to be a 
reference to the ``Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Salt Pond Visitor Center''.
    (d) Signage.--The Secretary of the Interior may post an 
interpretive sign at the visitor center that--
            (1) includes information on Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., and his 
        contributions as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives;
            (2) includes an image of Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr.; and
            (3) refers to his efforts to aid in the preservation of the 
        national seashore and other national parks in Massachusetts.

   on Veterans' Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on Foreign

                jurisdiction of the committee concerned

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for designation of the period beginning April 9, 
     2012, and ending May 6, 2012, as ``Bataan-Corregidor Month''.

Whereas April 9, 2012, and May 6, 2012, mark the 70th anniversaries of the fall 
        of Bataan and Corregidor, respectively, to Japanese forces;
Whereas upon the outbreak of war between the United States and Japan in World 
        War II, approximately 100,000 members of the organized military forces 
        of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines who had been 
        called into the service of the United States Armed Forces by order of 
        President Roosevelt dated July 26, 1941, were committed to battle, along 
        with United States personnel, against Japanese forces that invaded the 
        Philippines on December 8, 1941;
Whereas the Filipino and United States defenders of the Philippines engaged 
        Japanese forces from the beaches of the Philippine islands to the last 
        defense of Bataan and Corregidor in a grueling battle lasting 150 days;
Whereas the enormous sacrifices of the defenders in the battles of Bataan and 
        Corregidor provided the United States and its Allies with valuable time 
        to prepare their armed forces for a counteroffensive campaign against 
        Japan;
Whereas in that defense, the members of the Filipino forces and their United 
        States counterparts struggled against difficult odds and desperate 
        circumstances and faced, with indomitable spirit, fortitude, and loyalty 
        to the United States, powerful Japanese forces;
Whereas the surrender of United States and Filipino troops on April 9, 1942, on 
        the Bataan Peninsula led to the infamous Bataan Death March;
Whereas as many as 11,000 of the approximately 78,000 prisoners of war (12,000 
        United States and 66,000 Filipino troops) died during the march to Camp 
        O'Donnell prison camp;
Whereas the survivors' suffering did not end with the march, as over twice as 
        many prisoners died in the first two months of imprisonment at Camp 
        O'Donnell as did on the march, and thousands later died of 
        malnourishment, disease, exhaustion, physical abuse, or by execution;
Whereas members of the Filipino forces acquitted themselves nobly during the 
        Bataan Death March, during their internment in death camps, and 
        throughout 3 years of resistance against Japanese occupation of the 
        Philippines;
Whereas more than 140,000 Filipino soldiers fought in units of the United States 
        Army during World War II, and many other Filipinos fought during World 
        War II in units that had no ties or only informal ties to the United 
        States Army;
Whereas the remains of over 17,000 members of the United States Armed Forces are 
        buried in the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines;
Whereas the United States and the Philippines enjoy strong historical ties and 
        an enduring friendship; and
Whereas the United States recognizes the sacrifice, loyalty, and valuable 
        contribution of the Filipino and United States World War II veterans to 
        the causes of peace, freedom, and human dignity: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the House of Representatives--
                    (A) supports the designation of ``Bataan-Corregidor 
                Month''; and
                    (B) requests that the President issue a 
                proclamation designating such a month and calling upon 
                the people of the United States to observe that period 
                with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including 
                the recognition of veterans who served in the Bataan 
                Peninsula and Corregidor in the Philippines during 
                World War II; and
            (2) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
        United States and Filipino veterans deserve recognition for 
        their bravery in defending Bataan and Corregidor and valiant 
        service during World War II.

                             April 19, 2012

   Mr. Wicker (for himself, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Boozman, Mr.

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 75th anniversary of the founding of Ducks Unlimited, 
     Incorporated, the achievements of the organization in habitat 
conservation, and the support of the organization for the waterfowling 
                     heritage of the United States.

Whereas Ducks Unlimited, Incorporated (referred to in this preamble as ``Ducks 
        Unlimited'') was founded in 1937, when the drought-plagued waterfowl 
        populations of North America plunged to unprecedented lows;
Whereas, after decades of commitment to conserving waterfowl habitats, Ducks 
        Unlimited has become the largest private organization for waterfowl and 
        wetlands conservation worldwide and one of the most effective private 
        organizations dedicated to that cause;
Whereas, since the founding of Ducks Unlimited, the organization has conserved 
        and protected more than 4,500,000 acres of waterfowl habitat in the 
        United States and more than 12,600,000 acres of waterfowl habitat in 
        North America;
Whereas Ducks Unlimited has nearly 750,000 members internationally, including 
        550,000 members in the United States;
Whereas, since the founding of Ducks Unlimited, the organization has raised more 
        than $3,400,000,000 for waterfowl conservation and education, leveraging 
        public support to obtain more than half of its contributions from 
        private sources;
Whereas Ducks Unlimited provides support to local projects that are important to 
        waterfowlers in each State of the United States; and
Whereas Ducks Unlimited maintains the vital mission of conserving, restoring, 
        and managing wetlands and associated habitats for the waterfowl of North 
        America, a mission that also benefits other wildlife and people: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the important contributions of 
Ducks Unlimited, Incorporated and its members across the United States 
to the conservation of habitats and the preservation of the waterfowl 
of North America during the past 75 years.

                               RESOLUTION


 
            Celebrating the 140th anniversary of Arbor Day.

Whereas Arbor Day was founded in Nebraska City, Nebraska on April 10, 1872, to 
        recognize the importance of planting trees;
Whereas it is estimated that on the first Arbor Day, more than 1,000,000 trees 
        were planted in the State of Nebraska alone;
Whereas Arbor Day is observed in all 50 States and across the world;
Whereas participating in Arbor Day activities promotes civic participation and 
        highlights the importance of planting and caring for trees and 
        vegetation;
Whereas those activities provide an opportunity to convey to future generations 
        the value of land and stewardship;
Whereas National Arbor Day is observed on the last Friday of April each year; 
        and
Whereas April 27, 2012, marks the 140th anniversary of Arbor Day: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes April 27, 2012, as National Arbor Day;
            (2) celebrates the 140th anniversary of Arbor Day;
            (3) supports the goals and ideals of Arbor Day; and
            (4) encourages the people of United States to participate 
        in Arbor Day activities.

_______________________________________________________________________


                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 26, 2012

Mr. Rockefeller (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Pryor, 
and Mr. Thune) submitted the following resolution; which was considered 
                             and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of May 2012 as National Youth 
                         Traffic Safety Month.

Whereas motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for youth in the 
        United States;
Whereas thousands of youth are injured or die each year in motor vehicle 
        crashes;
Whereas on average, 11 youths die each day in motor vehicle crashes;
Whereas on average, May through August is the deadliest period for youths on our 
        nation's highways;
Whereas on average, 8 of the top 10 deadliest days for youths on our nation's 
        highways were between May and August;
Whereas events such as prom and graduation, and the summer driving season, 
        contribute to the risk of a motor vehicle crash due to an increase in 
        the amount of time youth spend on the road and in celebratory 
        activities;
Whereas it is essential to teach our youths that driving is a privilege and with 
        that privilege comes risks and responsibilities;
Whereas this education is essential to preventing risky behaviors that can 
        result in tragic crashes;
Whereas the National Organizations For Youth Safety (NOYS) established a 
        national youth campaign and National Youth Traffic Safety Month to draw 
        attention to the increased rate of motor vehicle crashes involving youth 
        between May and August, to help enforce youth safe driving laws, and to 
        support youth and community education on youth traffic safety; and
Whereas NOYS invites all youths, families, and communities to participate in 
        National Youth Traffic Safety Month:
Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) expresses support for the designation of May 2012 as 
        ``National Youth Traffic Safety Month'';
            (2) supports youth traffic safety awareness; and
            (3) encourages people across the United States to observe 
        National Youth Traffic Safety Month with appropriate programs, 
        activities, and ceremonies.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Strategic and Critical 
Minerals Production Act of 2012''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The industrialization of China and India has driven 
        demand for nonfuel mineral commodities, sparking a period of 
        resource nationalism exemplified by China's reduction in 
        exports of rare-earth elements necessary for 
        telecommunications, military technologies, healthcare 
        technologies, and conventional and renewable energy 
        technologies.
            (2) The availability of minerals and mineral materials are 
        essential for economic growth, national security, technological 
        innovation, and the manufacturing and agricultural supply 
        chain.
            (3) The exploration, production, processing, use, and 
        recycling of minerals contribute significantly to the economic 
        well-being, security and general welfare of the Nation.
            (4) The United States has vast mineral resources, but is 
        becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign sources of these 
        mineral materials, as demonstrated by the following:
                    (A) Twenty-five years ago the United States was 
                dependent on foreign sources for 30 nonfuel mineral 
                materials, 6 of which the United States imported 100 
                percent of the Nation's requirements, and for another 
                16 commodities the United States imported more than 60 
                percent of the Nation's needs.
                    (B) By 2011 the United States import dependence for 
                nonfuel mineral materials had more than doubled from 30 
                to 67 commodities, 19 of which the United States 
                imported 100 percent of the Nation's requirements, and 
                for another 24 commodities, imported more than 50 
                percent of the Nation's needs.
                    (C) The United States share of world wide mineral 
                exploration dollars was 8 percent in 2011, down from 19 
                percent in the early 1990s.
                    (D) In the 2012 Ranking of Countries for Mining 
                Investment, out of 25 major mining countries, the 
                United States ranked last with Papua New Guinea in 
                permitting delays, and towards the bottom regarding 
                government take and social issues affecting mining.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Strategic and critical minerals.--The term ``strategic 
        and critical minerals'' means minerals that are necessary--
                    (A) for national defense and national security 
                requirements;
                    (B) for the Nation's energy infrastructure, 
                including pipelines, refining capacity, electrical 
                power generation and transmission, and renewable energy 
                production;
                    (C) to support domestic manufacturing, agriculture, 
                housing, telecommunications, healthcare, and 
                transportation infrastructure; and
                    (D) for the Nation's economic security and balance 
                of trade.
            (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any agency, 
        department, or other unit of Federal, State, local, or tribal 
        government, or Alaska Native Corporation.
            (3) Mineral exploration or mine permit.--The term ``mineral 
        exploration or mine permit'' includes plans of operation issued 
        by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service 
        pursuant to 43 CFR 3809 and 36 CFR 228A respectively.

  TITLE I--DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SOURCES OF STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL 
                                MINERALS

SEC. 101. IMPROVING DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL MINERALS.

    Domestic mines that will provide strategic and critical minerals 
shall be considered an ``infrastructure project'' as described in 
Presidential Order ``Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and 
Review of Infrastructure Projects'' dated March 22, 2012.

SEC. 102. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEAD AGENCY.

    (a) In General.--The lead agency with responsibility for issuing a 
mineral exploration or mine permit shall appoint a project lead who 
shall coordinate and consult with other agencies, cooperating agencies, 
project proponents and contractors to ensure that agencies minimize 
delays, set and adhere to timelines and schedules for completion of 
reviews, set clear permitting goals and track progress against those 
goals.
    (b) The lead agency with responsibility for issuing a mineral 
exploration or mine permit may determine any such action would not 
constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality 
of the human environment within the meaning of the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 because the procedural and substantive 
safeguards of the lead agency's permitting process alone, any 
applicable State permitting process alone, or a combination of the two 
processes together provide an adequate mechanism to ensure that 
environmental factors are taken into account.
    (c) The lead agency with responsibility for issuing a mineral 
exploration or mine permit shall enhance government coordination on 
permitting and review by avoiding duplicative reviews, minimizing 
paperwork and engaging other agencies and stakeholders early in the 
process. The lead agency shall consider the following best practices:
            (1) Deferring to and relying upon baseline data, analysis 
        and reviews preformed by State agencies with jurisdiction over 
        the proposed project.
            (2) Conducting reviews concurrently rather than 
        sequentially to the extent practicable and when such concurrent 
        review will expedite rather than delay a decision.
    (d) At the request of a project proponent, the project lead of the 
agency with responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine 
permit shall enter into an agreement with the project proponent and 
other cooperating agencies that sets time limits for each part of the 
permit review process including:
            (1) The decision on whether to prepare an environmental 
        impact statement.
            (2) A determination of the scope of any environmental 
        impact statement.
            (3) Preparation of any draft environmental impact 
        statement.
            (4) Preparation of a final environmental impact statement.
            (5) Consultations required under applicable laws.
            (6) Submission and review of any comments required under 
        applicable law.
            (7) Publication of any public notices required under 
        applicable law.
            (8) A final or any interim decisions.
    (e) In no case should the total review process described in section 
2(d) exceed 30 months unless agreed to by the signatories of the 
agreement.
    (f) The lead agency is not required to address agency or public 
comments that were not submitted during the public comment periods 
provided by the lead agency or otherwise required by law.
    (g) The lead agency will determine the amount of financial 
assurance for reclamation of a mining site, which must cover the 
estimated cost if the lead agency were to contract with a third party 
to reclaim the operations according to the reclamation plan, including 
construction and maintenance costs for any treatment facilities 
necessary to meet Federal, State or tribal environmental standards.

SEC. 103. CONSERVATION OF THE RESOURCE.

    In developing the mineral exploration or mine permit, the priority 
of the lead agency shall be to maximize the development of the mineral 
resource, while mitigating environmental impacts, so that more of the 
mineral resource can be brought to the market place.

SEC. 104. FEDERAL REGISTER PROCESS FOR MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINING 
              PROJECTS.

    (a) Preparation of Federal Notices for Mineral Exploration and Mine 
Development Projects.--The preparation of Federal Register notices 
required by law associated with the issuance of a mineral exploration 
or mine permit shall be delegated to the organization level within the 
agency responsible for issuing the mineral exploration or mine permit. 
All Federal Register notices regarding official document availability, 
announcements of meetings, or notices of intent to undertake an action 
shall be originated and transmitted to the Federal Register from the 
office where documents are held, meetings are held, or the activity is 
initiated.
    (b) Departmental Review of Federal Register Notices for Mineral 
Exploration and Mining Projects.--Absent any extraordinary circumstance 
or except as otherwise required by any Act of Congress, each Federal 
Register notice described in subsection (a) shall undergo any required 
reviews within the Department of the Interior or the Department of 
Agriculture and be published in its final form in the Federal Register 
no later than 30 days after its initial preparation.

TITLE II--JUDICIAL REVIEW OF AGENCY ACTIONS RELATING TO EXPLORATION AND 
                              MINE PERMITS

SEC. 201. DEFINITIONS FOR TITLE.

    In this title the term ``covered civil action'' means a civil 
action containing a claim under section 702 of title 5, United States 
Code, regarding agency action affecting a mineral exploration or mine 
permit.

SEC. 202. TIMELY FILINGS.

    A covered civil action is barred unless filed no later than the end 
of the 60-day period beginning on the date of the final Federal agency

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for designation of the week of April 16 through 
         April 20, 2012, as National Assistant Principals Week.

Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the National 
        Association of Elementary School Principals have declared the week of 
        April 16 through April 20, 2012, as National Assistant Principals Week;
Whereas the assistant principal is responsible for establishing a positive 
        learning environment and building strong school-community relationships;
Whereas the assistant principal is a member of the school administrative team 
        who interacts with sectors of the school community, including support 
        staff, instructional staff, students, and parents;
Whereas assistant principals play a pivotal role in the instructional leadership 
        of the school by conducting instructional supervision, mentoring 
        teachers, recognizing the achievements of staff, encouraging 
        collaboration, ensuring the implementation of best practices, monitoring 
        student achievement goals and progress, facilitating and modeling data-
        driven decisionmaking to inform instruction, and guiding the direction 
        of targeted intervention and continual school improvement;
Whereas the day-to-day logistical operations of schools require assistant 
        principals to monitor and address facility needs, attendance, 
        transportation issues, and scheduling, as well as supervise extra- and 
        co-curricular events;
Whereas assistant principals are entrusted with maintaining an inviting, safe, 
        and orderly school environment that supports the growth and achievement 
        of each and every student by nurturing positive peer relationships, 
        recognizing student achievement, serving as mediators, analyzing 
        behavior patterns, providing interventions, and conducting discipline;
Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals/Virco National 
        Assistant Principal of the Year program began in 2004 to recognize 
        outstanding middle and high school assistant principals who have 
        demonstrated success in leadership, curriculum, and personalization; and
Whereas the week of April 16 through April 20, 2012, would be an appropriate 
        week to designate as National Assistant Principals Week: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of National Assistant 
        Principals Week;
            (2) honors and recognizes the contributions of assistant 
        principals to the success of students in schools in the United 
        States; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Assistant Principals Week with appropriate ceremonies 
        and activities that promote awareness of school leadership in 
        ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality 
        education.

        Palestinian people for peace with Israel.

SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY.

    Chapter 1 of part III of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is 
amended--
            (1) by redesignating the second section 620J (as added by 
        section 651 of Public Law 110-161) as section 620M; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:

    ``(a) Prohibition of Funds.--No funds may be provided under this

accounting procedures in place to ensure that the funds are properly 
disbursed. Such report shall also detail the steps the Palestinian 
Authority has taken to arrest terrorists, confiscate weapons, and 
dismantle the terrorist infrastructure.
    ``(d) Certification.--If the President exercises the waiver 
authority under subsection (b), the Secretary of State shall certify 
and report to the Committees on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
Representatives and Foreign Relations of the Senate prior to the

        all financing mechanisms flow through this account, no parallel 
        financing mechanisms exist outside of the Palestinian Authority 
        treasury account, and there is a single comprehensive civil 
        service roster and payroll; and

                                 A BILL


 
To impose sanctions on persons responsible for the detention, abuse, or 
  death of Sergei Magnitsky, and for other gross violations of human 
       rights in the Russian Federation, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law 
Accountability Act of 2012''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States aspires to a mutually beneficial 
        relationship with the Russian Federation based on respect for 
        human rights and the rule of law, and supports the people of 
        the Russian Federation in their efforts to realize their full 
        economic potential and to advance democracy, human rights, and 
        the rule of law.
            (2) The Russian Federation--
                    (A) is a member of the United Nations, the 
                Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, 
                the Council of Europe, and the International Monetary 
                Fund;
                    (B) has ratified the Convention against Torture and 
                Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
                Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and 
                Political Rights, and the United Nations Convention 
                against Corruption; and
                    (C) is bound by the legal obligations set forth in 
                the European Convention on Human Rights.
            (3) States voluntarily commit themselves to respect 
        obligations and responsibilities through the adoption of 
        international agreements and treaties, which must be observed 
        in good faith in order to maintain the stability of the 
        international order. Human rights are an integral part of 
        international law, and lie at the foundation of the 
        international order. The protection of human rights, therefore, 
        particularly in the case of a country that has incurred 
        obligations to protect human rights under an international 
        agreement to which it is a party, is not left exclusively to 
        the internal affairs of that country.
            (4) Good governance and anti-corruption measures are 
        instrumental in the protection of human rights and in achieving 
        sustainable economic growth, which benefits both the people of 
        the Russian Federation and the international community through 
        the creation of open and transparent markets.
            (5) Systemic corruption erodes trust and confidence in 
        democratic institutions, the rule of law, and human rights 
        protections. This is the case when public officials are allowed 
        to abuse their authority with impunity for political or 
        financial gains in collusion with private entities.
            (6) The Russian nongovernmental organization INDEM has 
        estimated that bribes by individuals and businesses in the 
        Russian Federation amount to hundreds of billions of dollars a 
        year, an increasing share of the country's gross domestic 
        product.
            (7) Sergei Leonidovich Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009, 
        at the age of 37, in Matrosskaya Tishina Prison in Moscow, 
        Russia, and is survived by a mother, a wife, and 2 sons.
            (8) On July 6, 2011, Russian President Dimitry Medvedev's 
        Human Rights Council announced the results of its independent 
        investigation into the death of Sergei Magnitsky. The Human 
        Rights Council concluded that Sergei Magnitsky's arrest and 
        detention was illegal; he was denied access to justice by the 
        courts and prosecutors of the Russian Federation; he was 
        investigated by the same law enforcement officers whom he had 
        accused of stealing Hermitage Fund companies and illegally 
        obtaining a fraudulent $230,000,000 tax refund; he was denied 
        necessary medical care in custody; he was beaten by 8 guards 
        with rubber batons on the last day of his life; and the 
        ambulance crew that was called to treat him as he was dying was 
        deliberately kept outside of his cell for one hour and 18 
        minutes until he was dead. The report of the Human Rights 
        Council also states the officials falsified their accounts of 
        what happened to Sergei Magnitsky and, 18 months after his 
        death, no officials had been brought to trial for his false 
        arrest or the crime he uncovered. The impunity continued in 
        April 2012, when Russian authorities dropped criminal charges 
        against Larisa Litvinova, the head doctor at the prison where 
        Magnitsky died.
            (9) The systematic abuse of Sergei Magnitsky, including his 
        repressive arrest and torture in custody by officers of the 
        Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation that Mr. 
        Magnitsky had implicated in the embezzlement of funds from the 
        Russian Treasury and the misappropriation of 3 companies from 
        his client, Hermitage Capital Management, reflects how deeply 
        the protection of human rights is affected by corruption.
            (10) The politically motivated nature of the persecution of 
        Mr. Magnitsky is demonstrated by--
                    (A) the denial by all state bodies of the Russian 
                Federation of any justice or legal remedies to Mr. 
                Magnitsky during the nearly 12 full months he was kept 
                without trial in detention; and
                    (B) the impunity since his death of state officials 
                he testified against for their involvement in 
                corruption and the carrying out of his repressive 
                persecution.
            (11) The Public Oversight Commission of the City of Moscow 
        for the Control of the Observance of Human Rights in Places of 
        Forced Detention, an organization empowered by Russian law to 
        independently monitor prison conditions, concluded on December 
        29, 2009, ``A man who is kept in custody and is being detained 
        is not capable of using all the necessary means to protect 
        either his life or his health. This is a responsibility of a 
        state which holds him captive. Therefore, the case of Sergei 
        Magnitsky can be described as a breach of the right to life. 
        The members of the civic supervisory commission have reached 
        the conclusion that Magnitsky had been experiencing both 
        psychological and physical pressure in custody, and the 
        conditions in some of the wards of Butyrka can be justifiably 
        called torturous. The people responsible for this must be 
        punished.''.
            (12) Sergei Magnitsky's experience, while particularly 
        illustrative of the negative effects of official corruption on 
        the rights of an individual citizen, appears to be emblematic 
        of a broader pattern of disregard for the numerous domestic and 
        international human rights commitments of the Russian 
        Federation and impunity for those who violate basic human 
        rights and freedoms.
            (13) The second trial, verdict, and sentence against former 
        Yukos executives Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev evoke 
        serious concerns about the right to a fair trial and the 
        independence of the judiciary in the Russian Federation. The 
        lack of credible charges, intimidation of witnesses, violations 
        of due process and procedural norms, falsification or 
        withholding of documents, denial of attorney-client privilege, 
        and illegal detention in the Yukos case are highly troubling. 
        The Council of Europe, Freedom House, and Amnesty 
        International, among others, have concluded that they were 
        charged and imprisoned in a process that did not follow the 
        rule of law and was politically influenced. Furthermore, senior 
        officials of the Government of the Russian Federation, 
        including First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, have 
        acknowledged that the arrest and imprisonment of Khodorkovsky 
        were politically motivated.
            (14) According to Freedom House's 2011 report entitled 
        ``The Perpetual Battle: Corruption in the Former Soviet Union 
        and the New EU Members'', ``[t]he highly publicized cases of 
        Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old lawyer who died in pretrial 
        detention in November 2009 after exposing a multimillion-dollar 
        fraud against the Russian taxpayer, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, 
        the jailed business magnate and regime critic who was sentenced 
        at the end of 2010 to remain in prison through 2017, put an 
        international spotlight on the Russian state's contempt for the 
        rule of law. . . . By silencing influential and accomplished 
        figures such as Khodorkovsky and Magnitsky, the Russian 
        authorities have made it abundantly clear that anyone in Russia 
        can be silenced.''.
            (15) The tragic and unresolved murders of Nustap 
        Abdurakhmanov, Maksharip Aushev, Natalya Estemirova, Akhmed 
        Hadjimagomedov, Umar Israilov, Paul Klebnikov, Anna 
        Politkovskaya, Saihadji Saihadjiev, and Magomed Y. Yevloyev, 
        the death in custody of Vera Trifonova, the disappearances of 
        Mokhmadsalakh Masaev and Said-Saleh Ibragimov, the torture of 
        Ali Israilov and Islam Umarpashaev, the near-fatal beatings of 
        Mikhail Beketov, Oleg Kashin, Arkadiy Lander, and Mikhail 
        Vinyukov, and the harsh and ongoing imprisonment of Mikhail 
        Khodorkovsky, Alexei Kozlov, Platon Lebedev, and Fyodor Mikheev 
        further illustrate the grave danger of exposing the wrongdoing 
        of officials of the Government of the Russian Federation, 
        including Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, or of seeking to 
        obtain, exercise, defend, or promote internationally recognized 
        human rights and freedoms.
